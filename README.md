This Django project is a fully-functional web application for image bookmarking and ranking. It includes the following features:

    User Authentication: A robust system that allows users to register, log in, and manage their profiles.
    Bookmarking Images: Users can save images from the web, categorize them, and view a personalized list of bookmarks.
    Image Ranking: The application enables users to like and rank images, contributing to community-driven popularity scores.
    Interactive UI Elements: The project integrates custom front-end components such as a bookmarklet tool for easy image saving and real-time interactions via JavaScript.
    Media Handling: The application supports user-uploaded images and provides storage and display functionality using Djangoâ€™s media file management system.
    Admin Interface: Built-in Django admin functionality allows for easy management of users, bookmarks, and rankings.

It uses SQLite for the database, with modular Django apps such as "images" and "actions" for clean separation of concerns. The app also comes with a clean and responsive UI.
